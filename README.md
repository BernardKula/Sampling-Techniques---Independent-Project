# Sampling-Techniques---Independent-Project

## Background Information<br />
Your goal for this project will be to create a sampling plan for a research question that
you will formulate. This project will help you think critically about the data
collection/sampling methodologies that you've learned.<br />

## Problem Statement<br />
Your expected sampling plan will contain the following sections:<br />
### 1. Sampling Strategy<br />

##### Objectives and Reliability Requirements<br />
● A description of the sampling effort, the time frame, and the estimated
parameter value(s). For example, the objective is determining the mean
monthly value of parameter X during the crediting period.<br />

##### Target Population
● A definition of the target population.<br />
● A description of any particular features associated with the target
population.<br />

##### Sampling Method<br />
● A selection and description of the sampling method e.g. simple random
sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, etc.<br />
● Strata or clusters need to be clearly identified if sampling other than
simple random sampling is to be used.<br />

##### Sample Size<br />
● Addressing and justifying the target number of units/pieces of equipment,
solar cookers, buildings, motors, log-books, etc. which are to be studied
(i.e. the sample size).<br />
● Justification shall include the parameter of interest, the value it is
expected to take, and an estimate of the variance associated with the
data.<br />

##### Sampling Frame<br />
● Identification or description of the sampling frame to be used.<br />
● This shall agree with the information about the target population and
sampling design above. For instance, if cluster sampling is to be used in a
study of equipment in buildings, then the frame should be a listing of the
buildings from which the sample will be selected.<br />

### 2. Data<br />

##### Field Measurements<br />
● Identification of all the variables to be measured, and the timing and
frequency of the measurements. Methods of measurement shall be
described as appropriate.<br />

##### Quality Assurance / Quality Control<br />
● Description of how to achieve good quality data, e.g. describing the
procedures for conducting the data collection and/or field measurements
including training of field personnel, provisions for maximizing response
rates, documenting out-of-population cases, refusals, and other sources
of non-response, and related issues.<br />
● Overall quality control and assurance strategy shall be documented in the
plan. This shall include a procedure for defining outliers and under what
circumstances measurements may be excluded and/or replaced.<br />

##### Analysis<br />
● Description of how the data will be used.<br />
● Role of normality within the worked on data.<br />

### 3. Implementation

##### Implementation Plan<br />
● Definition of the schedule for implementing the sampling effort and
identify who will conduct the actual data collection and the analyses.<br />
● Inclusion of qualifications, experience, and any potential conflicts of
interest of those involved in the data collection and analyses.<br />
Note that you will not be required to perform any implementation within the scope of this
